## HOW DOES THIS APP WORK?
* WAIT IT OUT offers three main categories: FOOD, SHOPPING & ENTERTAINMET
* When users click on any of the categories, thee sub-categories will be offered
* When users make a selection, the app will fetch data from Google Places API by making an AJAX call. As a response, the top three nearby places will be displayed on the screen.
* Then, users may select the location of their liking, and a map will be displayed using Google Maps API.
* The map will display directions guiding our users to get from their current location (point A) to their desired destination (point B)
* A 'home icon' is displayed a the bottom of the screen to make it easy for our users to get back to our home page.
